			<p class="info">Hello everyone, my name is Jack Kudrna and I'm a Communication Arts major at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" style="font-family: Georgia, serif">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. I was born and raised in Savage, Minnesota (a suburb about 20 minutes south of Minneapolis), and my passions consist of listening to music, following sports (whether that be watching them, reading up on them, attending them, you name it), playing video games, and hanging out with family and friends. <br> <br> With music being one of my main passions, I'd like to share that my favorite genre of music is Hip-Hop/Rap, with <b>Travis Scott</b>, <b>Drake</b>, <b>Big Sean</b>, and <b>Future</b> being some of my favorite artists. <br> <br> My favorite sports to watch are football, basketball, and baseball, with my favorite teams being the <b>Denver Broncos</b>, <b>Minnesota Timberwolves</b>, and <b>Minnesota Twins</b> respectfully. <br> <br> Finally, my favorite video game console is Xbox (my go-to system right now being the Xbox One) and some of my favorite video games of all time are sports games like <i>Madden</i> and <i>NBA 2K</i>, as well as shooter games like <i>Call of Duty</i> and <i>Fortnite</i>.</p>
